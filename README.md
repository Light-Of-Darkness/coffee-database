Coffee Database Web App

This is my code for a web app that allows a user to add a recipe for brewing coffee to a Firestore database, and also retrieve the list of recipes for a particular brewer in the database.

To run it, download the source code, and add your own firestore.js by creating a Firestore project and adding the API keys. Then, run npm start in the directory.

This web app was bootstrapped by Create React App
